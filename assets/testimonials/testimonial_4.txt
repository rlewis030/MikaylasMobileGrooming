Mikayla is a great dog groomer! My pug can be very difficult in general, but Mikayla always takes such good care of her. She adapts her grooming techniques and procedures in order to make our dog as comfortable as possible and treats our dog like it was her own. Mikayla`s prices are fair and she provides a fantastic service! I would recommend her to anyone looking for a professional grooming service
