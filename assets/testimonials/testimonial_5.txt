Mikayla`s passion for dogs is very apparent in the attentive care and love that she has for our dog. He loves her back just as much. He is getting older and has some health issues and Mikayla knows how to care for him. She takes him on just the right length of walk to give him exercise without putting any strain on him. She also ensures he gets his meds when he needs them. She is reliable and always there when we need her. She is also an excellent dog groomer. I would definitely recommend Mikayla!
